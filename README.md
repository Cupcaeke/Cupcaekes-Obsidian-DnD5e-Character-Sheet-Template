# Cupcaeke's Obsidian D&amp;D5e Character Sheet Template
A D&amp;D5e character sheet template for Obsidian semi-automated to feel like a healthy mix of a classic paper/pdf sheet and DnDBeyond/Roll20!

That lil description says it all! This is essentially an Obsidian vault containing some templates and functionality with each other to have a partially automated interactible editable 5e Character SHeet! I've tried to do all the hard work for you so that it is mostly just plug-n-play; but there are a few things to know!
This vault primarily uses [ITS Theme](https://publish.obsidian.md/slrvb-docs/ITS+Theme/ITS+Theme), [DND UI Toolkit](https://hay-kot.github.io/obsidian-dnd-ui-toolkit/), [MetaBind](https://www.moritzjung.dev/obsidian-meta-bind-plugin-docs/) for funtionality. There is a config tab within the template that has some helpful tips if you aren't sure how to use these. But if you get stuck, familiarize yourself with these tools!

As of this initial release, the DnD UI Toolkit plugin has some major bugs that will appear in the screenshot below; but fret not, it is still receiving updates and the template is still fully functional despite these bugs!

Anyway here are some screenshots :3 Head over to the releases page for downloads! I don't plan on updating this repo very often, so you will likely have to update the plugins if you are downloading this later.

To install, just download the release and extract it wherever you please, then hit "open folder as vault" in Obsidian!
Have fun!!

I have no idea how to use github btw sorry
